a way to use this tool is to not forget all your passwords by uniting all of them in one.
So for example if you have 2 Accounts sharing the password 123;Those accounts are JasonGaming@gmail.com and Jasonstudying@gmail.com. if one gets compromised the other will because they share the same password but with this tool it will encrypt your password with the information of your email and passkey
so, let's say you want to encrypt jasongaming@gmail.com with the salt (123) it will first turn it to jasongaming@gmail.com (lower character) then encrypt it with base64 and sha256 also with the salt which is 123
So now the key for jasongaming is 'LGzkoR=1YS' and jasonstudying is 'hy*UeQL1sc'.
